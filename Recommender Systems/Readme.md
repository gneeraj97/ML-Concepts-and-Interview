# Recommender Systems

As the name suggests, a Recommender System is a "system" (read ML) that recommends something to someone. It can be automated, or a manual system. Here, we will try to understand the automated systems, as we will be discussing the ML concepts. 

**Note**: This repo assumes that you have an intermediate understanding of ML and its mathematical foundations.

### Types of Recommender Systems:
- Collaborative filtering
- Content-based filtering
- Hybrid recommender systems
- Context filtering

**Collaborative filtering**: The basic idea of this recommendation system is, that similar users like similar things. The item preferences 
of many users (collaborative part) is used to give top-k recommendations (filtering part) to other users.
